# Sunsynk IHD 35
An in-home display (IHD) for a Sunsynk hybrid inverter, using an ESP32 SoC and a 3.5" TFT touchscreen with an ILI9488 display driver.

Uses the Sunsynk API to retrieve near real-time data so no additional hardware or software integrations needed - if the inverter is reporting data to Sunsynk, and the Sunsynk app or website are showing it, the IHD will be able to display it.
